DATA STRUCTURES

    SPAN:-
        the following structure is uses to preserve the span from start to end till which the match is made
        the span output has a valid integer which indicates whether a valid match was found or not
        ** the range is left inclusive and right non-inclusive similar to python
        this is then modified in the main as per the given convention

    BUCKET:-
        its used to preserve a character class as a structure
        it consists of 3 arrays
        indiv_array:- stores individual characters
        range_array_start:- stores the corresponding start point
        range_array_end:- stores the corresponding end point

IMPLEMENTAION:-

the current regex apart from the given macros (\w \d and generic character class), the implementation includes even \s to match spaces.
greedy and non-greedy *,+,? are also taken into consideration completely
a recursive approach is taken and implemented to perform regex search.

the core function is 'regex_match_here' which performs match recursively.

the detailed explaination of the implementation is in the comments so please do go through it.
